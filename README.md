# coPY

coPY is a simple Python app with an intuitive GUI that allows users to copy all images from a directory in a matter of seconds. Simply pick your source directory using the native file lookup functionality on your computer or using the convenient buttons for iMessage or WeChat. After that, pick the directory where you would like the images to go and hit copy. After just a few seconds, all the photos will be copied and, importantly, will still be in the original directory too (to avoid having to redownload all of the images locally).
